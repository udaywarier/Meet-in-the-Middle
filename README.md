# Meet-in-the-Middle
One day, a group of friends and I wanted to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner, but we lived so far apart that we didn't know which BWW location would be the one that was the closest to all of us, optimizing total average driving time, while also not making one person drive super far and the rest drive not as much. 

Currently, the program only works for this specific situation and is basically just a bunch of web page scraping using the Jsoup HTML parser. However, I am in the process of changing it so it works for n number of people, and for any location (not just BWW). This will probably be accomplished through even more web page scraping, but hopefully I will finally learn Google's developer API and thus be able to solve this in a more intelligent way.
